title: About
---

Madchan is an organisation founded to be an initiative that provides knowledge
and raises awareness about madness. It's hoped that those with lived experience
can share their stories and wisdom through the podcast. By lived experience we
mean those that have struggled with madness and hopefully conquered it.
Naturally we're all at different stages of the recovery process with the basic
premise being to help those suffering from madness or even inform those that
are curious about it.

It should be noted that Madchan wants to be a not for profit organisation in
which its volunteers sacrifice their time and energy to make it an organisation
worth vouching for. An organisation that advocates for people suffering from
madness. This is because a lot of people suffering from madness don't have a
voice of their own for their issues. We want Madchan to be a voice for these
people.

Madchan aims to be an educational resource to inform those with or without
madness. Community acceptance being a huge part of what Madchan aims to
achieve. We want to see those suffering from madness to have better outcomes in
the community and better guidance on their issues.

If you're interested in what Madchan does, simply tune in for the podcast:
what's supposed to be a non-invasive means of sending out the message that
we're all a bit mad, so let's be mad together.
